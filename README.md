My part is the Recommendation API. It’s a Python FastAPI microservice that fetches user ratings from the database, computes personalized book recommendations using collaborative filtering, and caches results in Redis for fast responses. The service is fully containerized with Docker, uses async operations for efficiency, and integrates smoothly with the rest of the distributed system.
